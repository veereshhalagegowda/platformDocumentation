## Overview 
Input-text component is a form control field to input user data such as numbers, alphabets, special characters, password, email, search etc. Input can be used within the forms to capture the data from the user. 

## Usage
Input component specifies an input field where the user can enter data. Input elements are used within a form element to declare input controls that allow users to input data. An input field can vary in many ways, depending on the type attribute.

### How to use   
1. Drag and drop the component. 
2. Double click the component to display the list of attributes that can be used with it.
3. Fill the attributes which are needed and save the page.

### Example 
1. Input the component field(s) with the attribute value(s):  
    `value = input text here`  
    `class = input`
2. Save it and run.
3. When the page is loaded the "value = input text here" will be the text that will be displayed and the "class = input" is the class name that can be used to point to a class in a style sheet. 

## Associated Attributes
- **Style:** It accepts a string value and affects the different properties (height, width, color etc.) of the component based on the values provided (eg. background:orange;height:200px;).
- **Class:** "Class" attribute is used to point to a class in a style sheet. A class contains one or more style statements. Classes are created inside the "Style" tab which is opened by selecting the "Style" side menu. The "Class" attribute accepts space separated class names (eg. class1 class2) which are defined in the "Style" tab as shown below.
    ```css
    .class1 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }
    .class2 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }```
- **Value:** It specifies the pre-defined text that is displayed in the text area when the application is run. Example “hello” defined in this field will display hello in the text field when the application is run.
- **Placeholder:** Used to hold the defined text value. Example “Name” holds the value Name for the text field.
- **Required:** Specifies that the text field should be filled and should not hold empty values. 
- **Color:** Takes the color based on the angular material theme.
- **Name:** Specifies the name for the text field.
- **Type:** Specifies the type of text to be input i.e number, text, etc.
