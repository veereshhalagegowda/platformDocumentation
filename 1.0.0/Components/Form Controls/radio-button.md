## Overview
A radio button is a button that can be either checked or unchecked. A user can tap the button to check or uncheck it. It can also be checked using the checked property. Use an element with a radio-group attribute to group a set of radio buttons. When radio buttons are inside a radio group, exactly one radio button in the group can be checked at any time. If a radio button is not placed in a group, they will all have the ability to be checked at the same time.

## Usage
Radio buttons are typically rendered as small circles, which are filled or highlighted when selected. It can be either checked or unchecked.

### How to use   
1. Drag and drop the component. 
2. Double click the component to display the list of attributes that can be used with it.
3. Fill the attributes which are needed and save the page.

### Example
1. Input the component field(s) with the attribute value(s):  
    `Checked = oncheck()`  
    `Value = option1`  
    In the "Ts" file write the following function:
    ```ts
    oncheck() { 
        alert("checkbox checked");
    }
    ```
2. Save it and run.
3. When the page is loaded the attribute "checked = oncheck()" is the event that runs when the radio button is checked. On checking the radio button the alert message "checkbox checked" will be displayed. The value attribute displays the value “option1” for the radio button.

## Associated Attributes
- **Style:** It accepts a string value and affects the different properties (height, width, color etc.) of the component based on the values provided (eg. background:orange;height:200px;).

The "Class" attribute accepts space separated class names (eg. class1 class2) which are defined in the "Style" tab as shown below.
    ```css
    .class1 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }
    .class2 {
        border-radius:10px;
        flex-basis:10%;
        height:100px;
    }```
